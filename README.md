Welcome to my dotfiles.

Everything here is managed with Chezmoi, a dotfiles manager that keeps a versioned directory of your dotfiles in `~/.local/share/chezmoi`

Please do not run `chezmoi apply` if you don't know what you are doing because this will override your dotfiles. If you want to use my chezmoi, then please run `chezmoi apply -x encrypted`

## Overview

Here's what's included:

### Productivity

* [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for my terminal emulator
* [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) as the file browser
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor
* [Arc Browser] (https://arc.net) for my web browser (Sorry I dont have the settings for this in my config ðŸ˜¢)
* [btop++](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) for task management

### Rice

* macOS with [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) + [skhd]() 
* [simple-bar](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar) as my menubar

## Notes
